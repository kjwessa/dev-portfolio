# Dev Portfolio

A simple static portfolio site built with HTML and CSS. The page highlights the
personal story of Kevin Wessa with cards for family, friends, web development,
and business interests.

## Project structure

- `index.html` – static markup for the single-page site.
- `style.css` – global styles and layout rules.
- `images/` – image assets referenced by the page.
- `fonts/` – custom web fonts used by the stylesheet.

## Getting started

No build tools are required. You can preview the site by opening
`index.html` directly in your browser:

```bash
# from the repository root
open index.html        # macOS
xdg-open index.html    # Linux
start index.html       # Windows (PowerShell)
```

Alternatively, serve the directory with any static file server (for example
`python -m http.server`) if you need to test on mobile devices.

## Maintenance notes

The project has not been actively updated in several years. If you plan to
extend the site, consider modernizing the layout, replacing outdated content,
and optimizing the images for current devices.
